# Encryption-Decryption-

This code takes in a file and either can encrypt or decrpyt the message inside using a basic Ceaser Cipher. It will only change letters but will keep the Capitalization, numbers, symbols the same. 

To run the code in Vscode type
python3 main.py

The code will then proceed to ask you for your file. Make sure that you include .txt to the file name. 

The either encryted or decrypted message will be labled encrypted.txt and decrypted.txt respectfully.
